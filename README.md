## 📖 **Overview**

**ResuMind** is a high-performance, AI-driven platform designed to bridge the gap between job seekers and recruitment algorithms. By leveraging modern LLMs and intelligent parsing, ResuMind provides an "insider's view" of how your resume is perceived by both robots (ATS) and humans.

### **The Problem**
75% of resumes are rejected by Applicant Tracking Systems before a human even sees them due to formatting errors or keyword mismatches.

### **The Solution**
ResuMind analyzes your document's structure, keyword density, and formatting to provide a **real-time compatibility score** and actionable steps to optimize it for modern hiring workflows.

## 🚀 **Key Features**

### **1. Intelligent Parsing & Analysis**
* **Deep PDF Extraction:** Uses `pdfjs-dist` to handle complex multi-column layouts and extract text accurately.
* **ATS Compatibility Scoring:** A proprietary scoring algorithm (0-100) that mimics modern recruitment software.
* **Keyword Gap Analysis:** Identifies missing industry-standard skills based on your target role.

### **2. Dynamic Visualizations**
* **Interactive Gauges:** Real-time animated feedback on your resume’s health.
* **Section Breakdown:** Granular scoring for Contact Info, Experience, Education, and Skills.
* **Actionable Tips:** Not just scores, but specific "Fix-it" instructions for your bullet points.

### **3. Privacy-First Experience**
* **Puter.js Integration:** Secure, decentralized authentication and cloud storage.
* **Local Processing:** PDF text extraction happens in the browser to ensure maximum data privacy.

## ⚙️ **How It Works**



1.  **Ingestion:** The user uploads a PDF. `react-dropzone` handles the UI, while `pdfjs-dist` extracts the raw text.
2.  **Analysis:** The text is processed via our AI logic to identify entities (dates, job titles, skills).
3.  **Scoring:** The system runs a multi-pass check against common ATS rejection triggers (poor formatting, missing sections, low keyword density).
4.  **Reporting:** Results are visualized through custom-built React components like `ScoreGauge` and `Details`.
